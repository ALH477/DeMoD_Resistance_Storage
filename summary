Resistance-Based Data Storage for Music
This project stores digital music files physically using electrical resistance in circuits. Binary data from music files (e.g., WAV) is encoded into resistance levels—low for '1', high for '0'—in a circuit powered and read via USB. It’s durable against EMPs or magnetic interference, suited for archiving, but less dense than modern storage like SSDs.
How It Works

Encoding: Music data is turned into a binary stream, mapped to resistance values. Voltage changes are measured to read it back, with error correction (Hamming parity) to fix mistakes.
Hardware: Scripts generate a PCB (KiCad) or ASIC (Verilog) to hold the encoded data physically.
Software: Python tools parse files (WAV, TXT, BIN), add error checks, and offer basic encryption (Caesar, Vigenère). A text interface (Textual library) controls it.
Setup: A Bash script installs and runs it on Linux, macOS, or Windows (via Git Bash/WSL).

Strengths & Limits
It’s a novel, physical storage method that’s tough against environmental damage but can’t match the capacity of flash drives or hard disks. It shows off skills in coding (front-end and back-end), hardware integration, and cross-platform design. Built by DeMoD LLC with Grok 4’s help.
